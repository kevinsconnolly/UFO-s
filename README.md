# UFO-s

Project Overview
For the UFO module, I built a table using data stored JavaScript array. I used unique filters to react to key data points that I type in and then place the unique search paramenters into an HTML for efficient, information slotting. Like before, I used bootstrap to customize the website with pictures and multiple seach filters to help those whoare interested in UFOs. The data used in the data.js was provided by the course and is unform and in a specific format, ensuring consistent data pulling. This is one of the greatest strenghts in code, which is creating a uniform data set that is easily searched, pulled and presented.

The Challenge wants us to create additional filters for the webpage, which is known as advanced filtering and can help use multiple, unique pieces of data to help fine tune searches. The five, total filter features are: Data, City, State, Country and Shape.

Another feature, search filter to add is how many unique experiences each person had during their life, a tracker of sort, to see if someone is predispoed to searches and view how prevelant UFO experiences are. This would be interesting to see if a certain person experiences UFOs more often than others which could help validate authenticity.
